ADATA v1.4
=======

ADATA is an efficient cross platform serialization library for C/C++, with support for Lua, C#, JavaScript and Java.

Note: JavaScript not test yet.

Features Overview
---------------

* Lightweight, fast and efficient serialization implementations, specifically for game development and other performance-critical applications
* Flexible, using keyword "delete" to mark discarded fields and a tag to record data length, that means forwards and backwards compatibility
* Header only, no need to build library, just a fews hpp files
* Strongly typed, errors happen at compile time
* Cross platform C/C++(03,11)/C#/Lua/Java/JavaScript code with no dependencies

Usage in brief
---------------

* Write a schema file that allows you to define the data structures you may want to serialize. Fields can have a scalar type (ints/floats of all sizes), or they can be a: string; array of any type; reference to yet another object
* Use adatac (the ADATA compiler) to generate a C++ header (or Lua/JavaScript script or Java/C#/ classes) with helper classes to access and construct serialized data. This header (say mydata.adl.h) only depends on adata.h/hpp, which defines the core functionality
* Store or send your buffer somewhere

Require for C++
------------

* GCC >= 4.0 or VC >= 8.0
* header only , no need to build lib.

Build the compiler
------------

To build adatac, we need:

* CMake 2.8 and newer
* GCC >= 4.9 or VC >= 12.0

Build adatac:

* Suppose that adata already unzip to dir adata/
* cd adata
* Make a dir named build
* cd build
* cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013"(or on unix-like platform: "Unix MakeFiles")
* Build whatever generated
* If success, will get a exe named adatac

Use the compiler
-------------------

adatac [-I PATH] [-O PATH] [-P PATH] [-G language] [--help]

* -I PATH: the adl file to generate, e.g. -I/home/username/work/project/xxx.adl
* -O PATH: the path that output generated files, e.g. -O/home/username/work/project/generated
* -P PATH: include path for other adl, could set more than once, e.g. -P/home/username/work/project/adl -P/home/username/work/project/include
* -G language: which language source to generate, could set more than once, e.g. -Gcpp -Glua(lua51,lua52,lua53,luajit) -Gcsharp -Gjs -Gjava
* --help: show help messages

Writing a schema (.adl file)
-------------------

Let's look at an example first

```

include = util.vec3;
include = my.game.quest;

namespace = my.game;

item
{
  int64 id;
  int32 type;
  int32 level;
}

player_v1
{
  int32 id; //player unique id
  string name(30); //player name
  int32 age;
  util.vec3 pos;
  list<item> inventory;
  list<my.game.quest> quests; //player's quest list
  float32 factor = 1.0;
}

player_v2
{
  int32 id; //player unique id
  string name(30); //player name
  int32 age [delete];
  util.vec3 pos;
  list<item> inventory;
  list<my.game.quest> quests; //player's quest list
  float32 factor = 1.0 [delete];
  list<int32> friends; //friend id list
}

```

### Data struct

Unlike other libraries, there is no keyword in adata data struct definition. All structs are names, e.g. the `item` in previous sample. This is the only way to define objects. Data struct consist of a name (here item, player_v1 and player_v2) and a list of fields. Each field has a type, a name, and optionally a default value.

Data struct is forward and backwards compatibility. User can use **[delete]** on a field to mark it as deprecated as in the example above(player_v2), which will prevent the generation of accessors in the generated code, as a way to enforce the field not being used any more. For compatibility, user can add new fields in the schema **only** at the end of a data struct definition. 

In the example above, player_v1 is an old version and player_v2 is new version, between them, diff are:

* Fields age and factor deprecated.
* New field friends.

User can:

* use player_v2 read player_v1's serialzation data. (forward compatibility)
* use player_v1 read player_v2's serialzation data. (backward compatibility)

if and only if user 1) add new fields only at the end of a data struct definition. 2) remove old fields by mark them [delete] 3) don't change old fields.

### Types

Built-in scalar types are:

* 8 bit: int8 uint8
* 16 bit: int16 uint16
* 32 bit: int32 uint32
* 64 bit: int64 uint64

Built-in non-scalar types:

* string: it's encoding depend on language. 
* list: list<type>, an array of data. Nesting lists is not supported, instead you can wrap the inner list in a data struct.
* map: map<key, value>, an directory of data. Nesting maps is not supported, instead you can wrap the inner map in a data struct.

User can optionally use "(num)" to limit max size of all non-scalar types. User can't change types of fields once they're used.

### Namespaces

These will generate the corresponding namespace in C++/C# for all helper code, and tables in Lua. You can use . to specify nested namespaces/tables.

### Includes

You can include other schemas files in your current one, e.g.:

```
include = file_path.file_name;
```

Actually, include is an adl file, adatac using -P arg to find these adl files for include, e.g.:

* User set -P to "C:\work\code\common".
* Under C:\work\code\common, there is one adl file named "util.adl"
* User can write "include = any_path.util" to include util.adl's defination data structs.

### Comments

Write "//" behind a field or single one line.

### Attributes

Attributes may be attached to a declaration, behind a field. These may either have a value or not. Currently, just one: "[delete]".

Use in C++
-------------------

Assuming you have written a schema using the above language in say player.adl, you've generated a C++ header called player.adl.h(rule: [name].adl.h), you can now start using this in your program by including the header. As noted, this header relies on adata/cpp/adata.hpp, which should be in your include path.

Note: generated C++ code support both C++03 and C++11.

Assuming adatac exe under adata/example/adl, player.adl under adata/example/adl/my/game, quest.adl under adata/example/adl/my/game, vec3.adl under adata/example/adl/util, the adatac command are:

* player.adl.h: adatac -Imy/game/player.adl -Putil -Pmy/game -Gcpp
* quest.adl.h: adatac -Imy/game/quest.adl -Gcpp
* vec3.adl.h: adatac -Iutil/vec3.adl -Gcpp

### Serialization

First of all, adata::zero_copy_buffer must be created:

```cpp

adata::zero_copy_buffer stream;

```

For serializing data, user need an byte array:

```cpp

#define ENOUGH_SIZE 4096
uint8_t bytes[ENOUGH_SIZE];
int32_t buf_len = ENOUGH_SIZE;

```

If user want know how length an object after serialization, using adata::size_of:

```cpp

// create a player_v1 object
my::game::player_v1 pv1;

// set pv1's value
pv1.id = 152001;
pv1.name = "alex";
pv1.age = 22;

// get the size of serialization(depend on its value, diff value may have diff size)
buf_len = adata::size_of(pv1);

```

Optionally, user can use this length to dyn create byte array:

```cpp

uint8_t* bytes = new uint8_t[len];

```

Then set the bytes to stream:

```cpp

stream.set_write(bytes, buf_len);

```

The last step to serialize is:

```cpp

adata::write(stream, pv1);
if (stream.bad())
{
  // some error, print it
  std::cerr << stream.message() << std::endl;
  std::abort();
}

// serialize success, data already write into bytes

```

### Deserialization

First set read data to stream:

```cpp

// User can copy bytes to other byte array or create other stream whatever.
stream.set_read(bytes, buf_len);

```

Create another player_v1 object, will deserialize data to it

```cpp

my::game::player_v1 pv1_other;

```

Now deserialize:

```cpp

adata::read(stream, pv1_other);
if (stream.bad())
{
  // some error, print it
  std::cerr << stream.message() << std::endl;
  std::abort();
}

// deserialize success, pv1_other should equals with pv1
// omit operator== for player_v1
//namespace my{ namespace game{
//bool operator==(player_v1 const& lhs, player_v1 const& rhs){
//  ...
//}}}

assert(pv1 == pv1_other);

``` 

And size_of pv1_other should also equals with pv1:

```cpp

assert (adata::size_of(pv1) == adata::size_of(pv1_other));

```

### Threading

Either read and write, adata::zero_copy_buffer is not threading-safe. Don't share stream between threads (recommended), or manually wrap it in synchronisation primites.

Creating adata::zero_copy_buffer doesn't using any dyn memory, it is cheap, so feel free to create it. 

Use in Lua
-------------------

Assuming you have written a schema using the above language in say player.adl, you've generated a lua script file called player_adl.lua(rule: [name]_adl.lua), you can now start using this in your program by require it. As noted, this script file relies on adata/lua/adata_core.lua, which should be in your lua path.

Note: adatac support lua four version: lua51 lua52 lua53 luajit(v2.0.3). User need set adatac arg to generate it: adatac -Gadt .

Note: right now adata only support embedde lua in to c/cpp and pure luajit.

Assuming adatac exe under adata/example/adl, player.adl under adata/example/adl/my/game, quest.adl under adata/example/adl/my/game, vec3.adl under adata/example/adl/util, the adatac command are:

* player.adt: adatac -Imy/game/player.adl -Putil -Pmy/game -Gadt
* quest.adt: adatac -Imy/game/quest.adl -Gadt
* vec3.adt: adatac -Iutil/vec3.adl -Gadt

and you can pack player.adt and quest.adt in one file pack.adt
*pack.adt adatac.exe -ppaley.adt -pquest.adt -opack.adt
### Serialization

First in c/cpp, user need include adata's header and call adata::lua::init_adata_corec: 

```cpp

#include <lua.hpp>

#include <adata_corec.hpp>

int main()
{
  lua_State *L = luaL_newstate();
  luaL_openlibs(L);
  adata::lua::init_adata_corec(L);
  // run script ...
}

```

Then in lua, require adata, player_adl.lua and quest_adl.lua:

```lua

local adata = require("adata")

adata.load('play.adt')
adata.load('quest.adt')
--or
--adata.load('pack.adt')
```

And create stream:

```lua

local buf_len = 4096
local stream = adata.new(buf_len)

```

Don't like cpp, in lua, zero_copy_buffer already have a buffer to write when created.

Now create player_v1 object and set its value to serialize:

```lua
-- create a player_v1 object
local pv1 = adata.types['game.player_v1']

-- set its value
pv1.id = 1
pv1.age = 22
pv1.factor = 2.0
pv1.name = "pv1"

local itm = player_adl.item()
itm.id = 11
itm.level = 321110
itm.type = 3
table.insert(pv1.inventory, itm)
itm = player_adl.item()
itm.id = 12
table.insert(pv1.inventory, itm)

local qst = adata.types['game.quest']
qst.id = 50
qst.name = "quest1"
qst.description = "There are something unusual..."
table.insert(pv1.quests, qst)

```

Then serialize:

```lua

pv1:write(stream)

-- serialize success, data already write into stream's write buffer

```

User can get write data:

```lua

-- data actually is a string
local data = stream:get_write_data()

```

### Deserialization

First set read data to stream:

```lua

stream:set_read_data(data)

```

Create another player_v1 object, will deserialize data to it

```lua

local pv1_other = adata.types['game.player_v1']

```

Now deserialize:

```lua

pv1_other:read(stream)

-- deserialize success, pv1_other should equals with pv1

```

Use in CSharp
-------------------

Assuming you have written a schema using the above language in say player.adl, you've generated a C# file called player.adl.cs(rule: [name].adl.cs), you can now start using this in your program by adding the file. As noted, this file relies on adata/csharp/adata.cs, which should be added in your project.

Assuming adatac exe under adata/example/adl, player.adl under adata/example/adl/my/game, quest.adl under adata/example/adl/my/game, vec3.adl under adata/example/adl/util, the adatac command are:

* player.adl.cs: adatac -Imy/game/player.adl -Putil -Pmy/game -Gcsharp -C
* quest.adl.cs: adatac -Imy/game/quest.adl -Gcsharp -C
* vec3.adl.cs: adatac -Iutil/vec3.adl -Gcsharp -C

### Serialization

First, create adata.zero_copy_buffer:

```csharp

var bytes = new bytes[4096];
var stream = new adata.ZeroCopyBuffer(bytes);

```

Now create PlayerV1 object and set its value to serialize:

```csharp

// create a my.game.player_v1 object
var pv1 = new my.game.PlayerV1();

// set its value
pv1.id = 152001
pv1.name = "alex"
pv1.age = 22

```

Serialize: 

```csharp

// rule: adata.[adl file name]_stream.stream_write
pv1.Write(stream);

// serialize success

```

### Deserialization

C#'s adata.zero_copy_buffer read and write shared same byte array, so this just use stream to read:

```csharp

// create other PlayerV1 to deserialize
var pv1_other = new my.game.PlayerV1();

// deserialize
pv1_other.Read(stream);

// deserialize success

```

pv1's value should equals with pv1_other and size_of also as well.


Use in Java
-------------------

Assuming you have written a schema using the above language in say player.adl, you've generated a directory with namespace as you defined(rule: my/game/), you can now start using this in your program by adding the file. As noted, this file relies on adata.jar, which should be added in your project.

Assuming adatac exe under adata/example/adl, player.adl under adata/example/adl/my/game, quest.adl under adata/example/adl/my/game, vec3.adl under adata/example/adl/util, the adatac command are:

* player.adl.cs: adatac -Imy/game/player.adl -Putil -Pmy/game -Gjava
* quest.adl.cs: adatac -Imy/game/quest.adl -Gjava
* vec3.adl.cs: adatac -Iutil/vec3.adl -Gjava

### Serialization

First, create adata.Stream:

```java

adata.Stream stream = new adata.Stream();
byte[] buf = new byte[4096];
stream.setReadBuffer(buf);```
stream.setWriteBuffer(buf);
Now create player_v1 object and set its value to serialize:

```java

// create a my.game.player_v1 object
my.game.player_v1 pv1 = new my.game.player_v1();

// set its value
pv1.id = 152001
pv1.name = "alex"
pv1.age = 22


//serialize: 

pv1.write(stream);

// serialize success

```

### Deserialization

java's adata.Stream read and write shared same byte array, so this just use stream to read:

```java

// create other player_v1 to deserialize
my.game.player_v1 pv1_other = new my.game.player_v1();

// deserialize
pv1_other.read(stream);

// deserialize success

```

pv1's value should equals with pv1_other and size_of also as well.

Use in JavaScript
-------------------
JavaScript as same as lua

### Serialization

First, load the .adt file

```javascript

var Long = require('long');
var adata = require('adata');

var s = new adata();
//callback_fn is the action when file load done.
s.load('./testpack.adt',callback_fn);

var callback_fn = function (){
  var playe_v1_type = s.type('my.game.player_v1')
  var pv1 = playe_v1_type();
//serialize: 
  v1.write(s);

//deserialize:
  var pv2 = playe_v1_type();
  v2.read(s);
}

```
